# openPIP: The open-source protein interaction platform
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7611596/156920773-e31827da-760d-4061-adf9-50e72f690ce1.png)

The Open-source Protein Interaction Platform (openPIP) is a customizable web portal designed to host experimental PPI maps. Such a portal is often required to accompany a paper describing the experimental data set, in addition to depositing the data in a standard repository. No coding skills are required to set up and customize the database and web portal. OpenPIP has been used to build the databases and web portals of two major protein interactome maps, the Human and Yeast Reference Protein Interactome maps (HuRI and YeRI, respectively). OpenPIP is freely available as a ready-to-use Docker container for hosting and sharing PPI data with the scientific community at http://openpip.baderlab.org/(http://openpip.baderlab.org/) and the source code can be downloaded from https://github.com/BaderLab/openPIP/(https://github.com/BaderLab/openPIP/).
